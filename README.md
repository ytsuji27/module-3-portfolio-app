# NotInstagram

NotInstagram is a Single Page Application (SPA) that lets users upload, comment and like photos. It was built with a Ruby on Rails based backend and a Javascript based frontend.

## Features
These are the key features and functionality built into the website:
* Upload a photo
* Show a full photo
* Add a comment to a photo
* Like/Dislike a photo

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome in all shapes and forms, especially bug fixes and feature additions.
To contribute, please fork the repository and create a separate branch that you can then commit and push.
Thank you!

## Next Steps
* Allow users to see all users who liked a certain photo
* Allow users to edit their comments
  * Add a timestamp to let users know a comment was edited
  * Maybe let users delete a comment, but add a placeholder to let others know a comment was deleted.
